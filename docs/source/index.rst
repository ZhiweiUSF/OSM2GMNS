`OpenStreetMap`_ (OSM) is a free, open-source, editable map website that can provide free
downloads. osm2gmns, as a data conversion tool, can directly convert the OSM map data
to node and link network files in the `GMNS`_ format. Users can convert and model drivable,
walkable, railway, or aeroway networks with a single line of Python code.

Besides, this package can novelty generate multi-resolution networks for transportation 
analysis with different intentions.
